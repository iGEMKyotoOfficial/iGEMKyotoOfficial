## Get started with development

### Preparation

First, clone this repository into your local directory:

```bash
# if necessary, go to the directory you want to clone the repository
cd /path/to/your/directory
# clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/iGEMKyotoOfficial/iGEMKyotoOfficial.github.io.git
```

Make sure Node.js is installed on your machine.
Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
cd iGEMKyotoOfficial.github.io
npm install
```

Everytime you pull the repository, you should run `npm install` to install the latest dependencies.

### Editing

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

You can see the result by opening [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser.

You can start editing the page by modifying each files. The page auto-updates as you edit and save the file.

When done with editing, you can build the project to see if it works:

```bash
npm run build
```
